# Little c program

## about

Bunch of mini-games made in C with the SDL library. I'm just just having fun, testing stuff and seeing what I can do. So far it has a Game of Life, and a little 2D spaceship flying game.

## compiling and launching

`make` to compile, `make clean` to clean, `program` to launch.
